## 1. Executive Summary
Prompt Injector is a desktop application for advanced AI security testing, designed to identify, test, and remediate prompt injection vulnerabilities across major AI agent solutions. It empowers security researchers, penetration testers, and AI developers to secure their AI systems against sophisticated attacks, including zero-day injection techniques.

## 2. Product Vision
To be the premier AI red teaming desktop application for the AI security community, providing comprehensive vulnerability assessment and advanced attack simulation for all AI agent platforms, while maintaining the highest standards of security and ease of use.

## 3. Problem Statement
AI systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection and adversarial attacks, yet there is no comprehensive, open-source, desktop-first tool for security researchers to systematically test, benchmark, and remediate these vulnerabilities across the rapidly evolving landscape of LLMs, agent frameworks, and multi-agent systems.

## 4. Target Market & Users
- **AI Security Researchers** (academic/industry)
- **Penetration Testers**
- **Red Team Operators**
- **AI/ML Engineers**
- **Bug Bounty Hunters**
- **Security Consultants**
- **Academic Researchers**

## 5. Goals & Success Criteria
- Detect and exploit emerging prompt injection attacks
- Provide advanced AI red teaming capabilities
- Enable security researchers and penetration testers to secure AI systems
- Maintain a localized, privacy-focused, open-source tools

## 6. Core Requirements
### Functional
- Universal AI agent integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models, agent frameworks)
- Advanced attack testing (direct, indirect, multimodal, adversarial)
- Detection engine (heuristic, ML, vector DB planned)
- Reporting and analytics (executive, technical, compliance)
- Local/offline operation, privacy-first
- Community features: attack sharing, plugin system, documentation

### Non-functional
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- <1s UI response, <15s per test
- <4GB RAM typical usage
- AES-256 encryption for local data
- No telemetry without consent

### Out-of-scope
- No cloud/enterprise SaaS features
- No managed hosting or multi-tenant cloud
- No commercial licensing or revenue goals

## 7. User Stories / Use Cases
- As a security researcher, I want to run red team campaigns against LLM agents to discover vulnerabilities.
- As a penetration tester, I want to benchmark AI systems against the latest prompt injection attacks.
- As an AI developer, I want to test my agent framework integration for security flaws before deployment.
- As a bug bounty hunter, I want to generate and share new attack payloads with the community.
- As a compliance officer, I want to generate reports mapping vulnerabilities to OWASP LLM Top 10 and NIST AI RMF.

## 8. Key Features (with rationale)
- **Universal AI Agent Integration:** Test all major LLMs, agent frameworks, and local models. (Breadth of coverage)
- **Cutting-Edge Attack Testing:** Simulate direct, indirect, multimodal, and advanced attacks. (Depth of testing)
- **Detection Engine:** Heuristic and ML-based detection, with vector DB planned. (Accuracy)
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate actionable, compliance-ready reports. (Stakeholder value)
- **Offline/Local Operation:** All data and models run locally for privacy. (Security)
- **Community & Extensibility:** Plugin system, attack sharing, and open documentation. (Growth)

## 9. Technical & Community Dependencies
- **Core:** Electron, React/TypeScript, Node.js, Python, Rust, SQLite
- **ML/AI:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Security:** OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS, academic benchmarks
- **Community:** GitHub, documentation, open source tools

## 10. Roadmap & Milestones
- **Phase 1:** MVP desktop app, core attack engine, basic UI, OpenAI/Anthropic/Google integration
- **Phase 2:** Advanced detection, agent framework support, MCP testing, performance optimization
- **Phase 3:** Research integration, community features, plugin system
- **Phase 4:** Polish, documentation, public release, community engagement

## 11. Risks & Mitigation
- **AI Model Changes:** Continuous research, modular architecture
- **Attack Evolution:** Active community, regular updates
- **Performance Issues:** Local optimization, resource management
- **Adoption:** Community engagement, open source focus
